The query aggregates land use data by fclass and geometry type, summing up the area for each unique combination where the name is specified. It is executed against the gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1 table.

QUERY PLAN:

Finalize GroupAggregate: This step indicates the completion of the aggregation process. The query has been executed in two phases: a preliminary aggregation (Partial HashAggregate) in parallel workers and a final aggregation to consolidate the results.

Group Key: The data is grouped by the fclass field and the type of geometry. These are the columns used to aggregate the total area.
Gather Merge: The results from the parallel workers are merged together. This is part of PostgreSQL's parallel execution plan where workers perform part of the computation and the coordinator node combines their results.

Workers Planned: PostgreSQL planned to use two workers for this query.
Workers Launched: Two workers were indeed launched, confirming the parallel plan was carried out.
Sort: Before the final aggregation, the intermediate results are sorted based on the group key. This is necessary for the GroupAggregate step to process groups correctly.

Sort Key: The sort operation is ordered by fclass and the output of GeometryType(geom).
Sort Method: quicksort is used, which is an efficient in-memory sort.
Memory: The amount of memory used by each worker for the sort operation is small (26kB), suggesting that the dataset for each worker is not large.
Partial HashAggregate: Each worker performs an initial aggregation of their subset of the data. The Group Key indicates the columns used for grouping.

Batches and Memory Usage: Show efficient use of memory with no indication of needing to spill to disk.
Parallel Seq Scan on gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1: The workers perform a sequential scan on the table to find rows where the name is not null.

Filter: Rows are filtered to exclude those with null names.
Rows Removed by Filter: Indicates a significant number of rows (39,992) do not have a name and are excluded from the result set.
Planning Time: Shows the query was planned extremely quickly (0.124 ms).

Execution Time: The total time taken to execute the query was about 759 ms, which is reasonable given the operations performed.

OVERALL ANALYSIS:

The query efficiently utilizes parallel processing to compute the total area for each land use category, grouping by fclass and geometry type. The majority of the time is spent in the actual execution of the parallel sequential scan and the aggregation process. The plan indicates that the data is well-suited for parallel processing, and the presence of a significant number of rows removed by the filter suggests that indexing the name column could further optimize performance for similar queries. The quicksort sorting method and the memory usage indicate that the dataset is managed efficiently in memory without needing to write to disk.
