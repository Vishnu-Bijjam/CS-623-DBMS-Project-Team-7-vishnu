This SQL query that calculates the percentage usage of each type of land (fclass) in the gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1 table. Here is the analysis of the query plan:

QUERY PLAN:

Finalize GroupAggregate: The server is completing an aggregation grouped by the fclass column. The actual execution time indicates the time it took to finish the final grouping and aggregation.

Group Key: The data is being grouped by the fclass column.
InitPlan 1 (returns $0): This is a subplan that returns a single value used in the outer query's calculations. It's executed before the main query.

Aggregate: An aggregation is performed to calculate the total count of rows in the table, which is used to calculate the percentage of each land type.
Index Only Scan using gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1_pkey: This indicates that the database has used an index-only scan to efficiently calculate the total number of rows. The Heap Fetches: 0 suggests that all necessary data was retrieved directly from the index without having to visit the table (heap), which is very efficient.
Gather Merge: This operation is part of the parallel processing mechanism, where the results from individual workers are combined.

Workers Planned/Launched: Two parallel worker processes were planned and used for the operation.
Sort: Before merging the results, they are sorted based on the fclass column.
Sort Method: quicksort is used, which is efficient for sorting in memory.
Memory: A small amount of memory (25kB) is used, which means the sort operation is entirely in-memory and efficient.
Partial HashAggregate: The initial stage of aggregation is performed by each parallel worker. They aggregate the data based on the fclass column.

Group Key: The data is grouped by fclass.
Batches and Memory Usage: Indicates that the aggregation was performed in a single batch and used a small amount of memory.
Parallel Seq Scan on gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1: A parallel sequential scan is done on the table to read the rows needed for the aggregation.

Filter: There is no filter applied in this step because the query is aggregating over all rows.
Planning Time: The time taken by PostgreSQL to generate the execution plan for the query was very short (0.181 milliseconds), indicating an efficient planning phase.

Execution Time: The actual time it took to execute the query and retrieve the results was approximately 137.3 milliseconds, which is quite fast.

OVERALL ANALYSIS:

The query effectively uses parallel processing to calculate the percentage usage of each land type. It benefits from an index-only scan for counting total rows, which improves efficiency. The actual sorting and aggregation steps are also done in memory without needing to access the disk, further contributing to the query's performance. The usage of parallel workers suggests that the table is large enough to warrant dividing the work, which PostgreSQL handles well.

The resulting plan demonstrates that the query is well-optimized, with the most resource-intensive part being the sequential scans done in parallel. The quick execution suggests that the server is well-configured to handle this type of query. If this kind of query is common and the dataset grows, continued monitoring of execution plans will help maintain performance.
